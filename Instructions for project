Below is where I got my data from:

Dr. Dirac knows the following probabilities based on many years of teaching:

There is a problem that 60% of students know the correct answer
Given that a student knows the correct answer, there is still a 15% chance that a student picked the wrong answer
Given that a student does not know the answer, there is still a 20% chance that the student picks the correct answer by guessing

Now these were the instructions for the project.

1.
In order to use Bayes Theorem, we need to phrase our question as P(A|B). What is A and B in this case?



2.
What is the probability that the student knows the material?



3.
Given that the student knows the material, what is the probability that she answers correctly?



4.
What is the probability of any student answering correctly?


5.
Using the three probabilities and Bayes Theorem, calculate P(knows material | answers correctly).
